•	The Object Selector Tool is used to click on, select and move objects within the figures. Clicking on any object selects it and deselects all others. A user can select multiple objects by holding shift while clicking on one object after another. If a user starts a mouse drag in a location without an object and drags over an area, all objects in the area will be selected after the mouse is released. When an object is selected, its handles will appear. A user can edit an object simply by dragging the handles. A user can right click on an object or handle to display a popup menu specific to the clicked object. If the user double clicks on an object or a handle, a dialog window with options specific to that object or handle may appear. If the user double clicks a text item, that item switches to “text edit mode” in which a user can edit its text via the keyboard. Clicking on another item, switches off text edit mode. For most objects, a set of icons composing a ‘mini toolbar’ will also appear below the clicked item. By clicking the icons in the mini toolbars one can perform nearly every type of edit. Most edits done with the mini toolbars apply to all selected objects. 
•	The Layout Selector Tool is a version of the object selector that selects only layouts (even if a layout is behind another object).
•	The basic shape tools can be used to draw a variety of shapes. A user can switch back to the Object Selector Tool by pressing the spacebar or enter. Right clicking on the tool icons shows the variety of alternate shapes. One may draw rectangles, circles, arrows, polygons, lines, curves, stars, gears, triangles, blobs, and other shapes. 
•	Add Text Tool is used to draw a fragment of text. A user can right click on this tool for access to specialized versions of it. The tool may also be used to edit text.
•	The Quick Figure Tool creates a new figure from a multidimensional image. If an image is open in ImageJ, that image will be used to create a figure, otherwise the user will be asked to choose a file. New figures may either be split channel or contain only the merged image depending on what the user has set as the default template.
